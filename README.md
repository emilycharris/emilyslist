_Simulated craigslist homework_

The objective for this assignment was to create a craigslist clone from front to back. 

The learning objectives for this assignment were to plan a full-scale project, include image upload and display, and provide a front-end layout.  In addition, we were required to plan out and execute the following features:

- Use Django authentication for registration and login
- Be able to select preferred city
- Include the ability to store city preference on user profile
- Include category and subcategory features
- Include a main page index listing categories & subcategories
- Prove the ability for a logged in user to post a new classified
- Provide listing views for any given subcategory including gallery, thumbnail and list views
- Include a posting detail page including images and navigation
- Provide the ability to sort by newest posting, and price (high-low and low-high)

As a second part of this assignment, we were also required to create API views with token authentication.  We were to provide API endpoints that allow a user to do the following: 

- Retrieve a list and detail of existing categories
- Retrieve a list and detail of existing subcategories
- Retrieve a list and detail of existing posts by category and subcategory
- Retrieve detail of a single post
- Create a new listing with all foreign key fields satisfied
- Update an existing post with the ability to change the subcategory the post belongs to
- Prevent a non logged-in user from creating or updating any records
- Prevent a logged in user from updating records created by another user.
- Use token authentication to allow a user to authenticate

The application was created using the Python programming language, as well as the Django web framework. The application also includes an API using Django REST Framework. Front-end development includes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The application was successfully deployed to the web using Render at the following address: https://emilys-list.onrender.com.
